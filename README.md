# Git-version

Python CLI tool to retrieve a PEP-compatible version based on git history and tags.

A large chunk of the code has been copied from [poetry-git-version-plugin](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-git-version-plugin/). Unlike that package, this action will work for other build tools than Poetry.
